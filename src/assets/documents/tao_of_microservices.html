</dl>
<p>Suppose a microblogging site has decided on a system that lets users post <em>entries</em>, or short pieces of text. The <em>MVP</em> includes the following <em>activities</em> and associated <em>messages</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Posting and entry
<em> <code>post:entry</code>
</em> <code>info:entry</code></li>
<li>Listing previous entries
<em> <code>store:list,kind:entry</code>
</em> <code>store:load,kind:entry</code>
<em> <code>store:save,kind:entry</code>
</em> <code>store:remove,kind:entry</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of getting lost in implementation, focus on the messages first and think about interaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the messages have been fleshed out, they are grouped into sensible <em>services</em>. One such implementation is provided in the diagram below.</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15or1k9CkpwEJadWjr9yW_T7tdN-CdLbT"></p>
<h4 id="iteration-1-a-search-index">Iteration 1: A search index</h4>
<p>In this iteration, a new activity and associated messages are added to the system</p>
<ul>
<li>Search through entries
<em> <code>search:insert</code>
</em> <code>search:query</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The search activity is added into the system as seen in the diagram below</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1hrqvRUuu3rq3zI8_BQtXyINW7FmVPtk0"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice the choice in implementation. <em>post</em> could have just as easily sent <code>search:insert</code> to <em>index</em>. However, doing so would couple <em>post</em> to <em>index</em>. Additionally, the decision for <em>index</em> to convert <code>info:entry</code> into <code>search:insert</code> messages can be made at runtime to maintain loose coupling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>index</em> can be added without any effect to the system. Since a previous version of <em>front</em> is already in production, the principle of <em>additivity</em> can be applied. Deploy the new version of the <em>front</em> service alongside the older version. Since both versions provide the same legacy functionality, nothing is broken. Both versions can used according to taste as the old version is gradually swapped out.</p>
<h4 id="iteration-2-simple-composition">Iteration 2: Simple composition</h4>
<p>While monitoring the system, suppose <em>entry-store</em> exhibits high latency while talking to the database. One possible solution is to implement a cache in a new service, <em>entry-cache</em>.</p>
<p>The service captures messages intended for <em>entry-store</em>. One such way to capture messages is to add an extra property such as <code>cache:true</code> to <code>store:*</code> messages. <em>entry-cache</em> will take the place of <em>entry-store</em> and <em>entry-store</em> will act as a fallback only listening to messages with the added property <code>cache:true</code>.</p>
<p><em>entry-cache</em> is trivial to introduce into the system but <em>entry-store</em> is a bit more complicated and will involve a transition phase. Using the process of <em>additivity</em> introduce the new version of <em>entry-cache</em> but with a runtime configuration that accepts both <code>store:*</code> and <code>store:*,cache:true</code> messages. Load-balancing would make it so some messages go strait to <em>entry-store</em> while others pass through <em>entry-cache</em> first. Once the new functionality proves itself, change the runtime configuration of <em>entry-store</em> to only accept <code>store:*,cache:true</code> messages.</p>
<p>The system now looks like the diagram below</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wr5tkpeh8kZFCrSp_nuE37hAC_-dY5pX"></p>
<h4 id="iteration-3-timelines">Iteration 3: Timelines</h4>
<p>Another core activity inside a microblogging framework is users following other users. Following the usual process, the first step is to come up with a set of messages representative of the activity,</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow user
<em> <code>follow:user</code>
</em> <code>follow:list,kind:followers|following</code>
<em> <code>timeline:insert</code>
</em> <code>timeline:list</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The naming of the messages suggest two new services, <em>follow</em> and <em>timeline</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By now a pattern should be forming, new functionality begets new services. This avoids technical debt by moving complexity into the message-routing configuration and out of the conditional code and intricate data structures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to the <em>index</em> service, we will have the new microservices react to <code>info:entry</code> with an orchestration of <code>follow:list,kind:followers</code> and <code>timeline:insert</code> messages. Instead of making complex routing and workflow rules, it is perfectly reasonable to make a service with the sole purpose of performing this orchestration. We will call this service <em>fanout</em>.</p>
<p>The system now looks like the diagram below</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1N6ibwy6TL07WREyFm3WlvUgdD_HR_j0d"></p>
<h4 id="iteration-4-scaling">Iteration 4: Scaling</h4>
<p>The microservices are scaling fine, but the underlying database of <em>timeline</em> cannot handle the data volume, and must be split into multiple databases.</p>
<p>One such technique, called <em>sharding</em>, assigns each item to a separate database, based on key values in the data. Though sharding can work at the database level, the microservice level is a good choice because it maintains flexibility. The <code>timeline:*</code> messages will have added <code>shard</code> property.</p>
<p>Adding the new sharding <em>timeline</em> microservice to the system looks similar to the process in Iteration 1 by using the principle of additivity. However, the transition will take longer due to batch-transferring the old database into the new database shards.</p>
<p>With that, this case study comes to a close with the final system diagram pictured below</p>

<h3 id="pattern-matching" class="ngc-header-link"><span header-link="pattern-matching"></span>Pattern matching</h3>
<p>A large part of complexity in a microservices system is the routing of messages. Pattern matching attemps to aleviate hat problem by allowing the network architecture to emerge dynamically from the properties of the messages. Using patern matching, message routing is reduced to the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Represent the message as key-value pairs (regardless of the actual message data).</li>
<li>Map key-value pairs to microservices, using the simplest algorithm you can think of.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="case-study-sales-tax-rules">Case study: sales-tax rules</h4>
<p>Suppose an online retailer begins work on calculating sales tax as one part of a general e-commerce solution. When the user adds a product to their shopping cart, the cart will have an update entry for the total sales tax due.</p>
<p>The retailer decides to model this business requirement with a synchronous <code>add-product</code> message that responds with an updated cart and a synchronous <code>calculate-sales-tax</code> message that responds with the gross price.</p>
<p>The properties of the <code>calculate-sales-tax</code> make it hard to distinguish between other messages with similar properties like the <code>add-product</code> message. Adding a label to the message (e.g. <code>label:sales-tax</code>) utilizes pattern matching to identify messages. </p>
<p>Pattern matching is also a good way to deal with changing business requirements. For example, suppose a product falls under one of two different sales tax categories, standard or reduced. A new microservice <code>sales-tax-reduced</code> will handle the reduced sales tax category while <code>sales-tax</code> will handle the standard category. Using pattern matching, a new key-value pair, <code>category:*</code> is added to the <code>calculate-sales-tax</code> message and routed according to the table below.</p>





















<table><thead><tr><th>Pattern</th><th>Microservice</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>label:sales-tax</code></td><td><code>sales-tax</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>label:sales-tax,category:standard</code></td><td><code>sales-tax</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>label:sales-tax,category:reduced</code></td><td><code>sales-tax-reduced</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

<h4 id="using-messages-to-expose-data">Using messages to expose data</h4>
<p>Messages are designed for the sole purpose of preventing the coupling that a shared database creates. This unlocks the ability to choose and change the database underneath a microservice without breaking other microservices.</p>
<h4 id="using-composition-to-manipulate-data">Using composition to manipulate data</h4>
<p>Representing data operations as messages gives you the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend data operations with a well-defined component model. A good example is adding a caching microservice.</li>
<li>Use alternative data-flow models like asynchronous write and syncronous read operations known as Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).</li>
<li>Adopt a reactive approach to data operations. More than one microservice can listen to data-operation messages.</li>
<li>Test microservices easily. You can mock up data operations in unit tests without overhead or dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="using-the-system-configuration-to-control-data">Using the system configuration to control data</h4>
<p>When data operations are represented as messages, yo can scale databases by changing the way the messages are routed. </p>
<p>For example, the diagram below details a typical deployment sequence for replacing a database shard with zero downtime.</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_OnNt5AXcHCR3JzXlcaIJ1UiapoTGQHc"></p>
<p>Similarly, you may also want to add to scale up or remove a shard to reduce complexity. The diagram below details the deployment sequence for spliting a shard.</p>

<h4 id="using-weaker-constraints-to-distribute-data">Using weaker constraints to distribute data</h4>

<dl>
<dt>Denormalization</dt>
<dd>
Keep a copy of local data entities. At a later time, propagate the local entities to the primary entities using methods such as batch process or change-announcement messages. This strategy trades data consistency for performance.

<h4 id="primary-keys">Primary keys</h4>
<ul>
<li>Synthetic keys are preferred, because they can be permanent and avoid the need to modify references.</li>
<li>GUIDs aren't an automatic choice. Although eminently suited to distributed systems, they have negative effects on performance, especially in relation to traditional database indexes.</li>
<li>You can use integer keys. They can still be unique, but they're weaker than traditional autoincrementing database keys.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="foreign-keys">Foreign keys</h4>
<p>In the world of distributed databases, JOIN is an operation that cannot be relied on because there is no guarentee that any given data entities are stored in the same database. There are alturnative to JOIN.</p>
<h4 id="transactions">Transactions</h4>
<p>Database transactions promise to satisfy the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. While these properties are nice to have, consider other options such as reservations, which relax these properties for performance gains.</p>
<h4 id="schemas">Schemas</h4>
<p> Schemas build technical debt. As business requirements change, the original schema is extended so that it doesn't break other parts of the system, while other parts of the schema become legacy structures that must be handled in the code base.</p>
<p>The microservices architecture approaches this problem as a matter of configuration, directing messages that make old assumtions to legacy microservices and new messages to new microservices.</p>

<ul>
<li>Failure is not an absolute binary condition, but a quantity that can be measured over many iterations. Therefore, it is more useful to consider the <em>failure rate</em> and define some meaningful threshold that marks success or failure.</li>
<li>A software system is not as unreliable as it's most unreliable component - it's <em>much more unreliable</em>, because other dependent components can fail, too.</li>
<li>Load balancing over multiple instances doesn't give you strong redundancy, it gives you capacity. Redundancy works for hardware because hardware eventually breaks. Redundancy does not work for software because software eventually works.</li>
<li>Software systems are not static, they suffer from deployments where several components change simultaneously. This strategy is inherently risky and almost always fails. Resolving production issues is equivalent to making another deployment attempt.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="continuous-delivery" class="ngc-header-link"><span header-link="continuous-delivery"></span>Continuous delivery</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Continuous delivery</dt>
<dd>
In the microservices context, create a specific version of a microservice and run one or more instances of that version in production, on demand.
</dd>
<dt>Primitive operation</dt>
<dd>
Adding/removing a microservice instance.
</dd>
<dt>Microservice artifact</dt>
<dd>
A microservice artifact can be a container, a virtual machine image or some other abstraction.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A continuous delivery pipeline contains a</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Version-controlled local development environment</strong> for each service, supported by small and medium tests.</li>
<li><strong>Staging environment</strong> to validate the microservice and build, reproducibly, an artifact for deployment. Validation is automated but can be manual.</li>
<li><strong>Management system</strong> to execute combinations of primitive operations against staging and production.</li>
<li><strong>Production environment</strong> constructed from deployed artifacts to the fullest extent possible. It contains a audit history of primitive operations, a self-correcting mechanism for dealing with crashes, and a load balancing solution.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and diagnostics system</strong> that verifies the health of the production system after a primitive operation is performed and generates alerts when the system is unhealthy.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pipeline">Pipeline</h4>
<ul>
<li>The pipeline requires tooling. Do not roll your own tooling; rely on the community first.</li>
<li>Be able trace all stages of the pipeline.</li>
<li>Mark and tag the source code so that artifact generation can be <em>hermetic</em>.</li>
<li>Artifacts are <em>immutable</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="protection">Protection</h4>
<p>Measure risk at each stage of production.</p>
<ul>
<li>In development, the key risk-measuring tools are code reviews and unit tests.</li>
<li>In staging, measure risk by monitoring message flows.</li>
<li>Continue to measure risk in production.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="running-a-microservice-system" class="ngc-header-link"><span header-link="running-a-microservice-system"></span>Running a microservice system</h3>
<h4 id="immutability">Immutability</h4>
<p>A microservice artifact is <em>immutible</em> if it can't be changed internally and it has only two active states: active and inactive. This preserves the ability to act as primitive operations.</p>
<h4 id="automation">Automation</h4>
<p>Microservice systems in production contain too many parts to be managed manually.</p>
<p>To determine which task to automate next, divide the tasks into two categories:  </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Toil</em> - tasks where human effort grows with at least O(n).  </li>
<li><em>Win</em> - tasks where human effort grows with less than O(n) </li>
</ul>
<p>where n is the number of microservice types. The next task to automate should be the task that most negatively impacts business goals from the <em>Toil</em> category.</p>
<h4 id="validation">Validation</h4>
<p>Continuous validation is essential to risk reduction and value in a CD pipeline. One valuable measurement is the ratio of one messages flow-rate to another messages flow-rate.</p>
<p>Deliberately test failure capabilities as a form of insurance. Take small, frequent losses to avoid large, infrequent, losses that are fatal.</p>
<h4 id="discovery">Discovery</h4>
<p>When microservice A knows that microservice B will receive it's messages, then A is <em>coupled</em> to B. Transport independence hides the mechanism of transportation from A, pattern matching hides the identity of B, and together, they decouple services.</p>
<p>Decoupled services need some way to discover each other. Some solutions include</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intelligent load balancing:</strong> Direct all traffic messages through load balancers that know where to find services.</li>
<li><strong>Service registries:</strong> Services register their location with a central registry, and other services look them up.</li>
<li><strong>DNS:</strong> Use the DNS protocol to resolve the location of a service.</li>
<li><strong>Message bus:</strong> Use a message bus to separate publishers from subscribers.</li>
<li><strong>Gossip:</strong> Use a peer-to-peer membership gossip protocol to share service locations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="configuration">Configuration</h4>
<p>Configuration can live immutably with the artifact or dynamically on the network. A total solution for a system will likely be a hybrid of the two.</p>
<p>Beware two dangerous configuration anti-patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation workarounds:</strong> Using configuration to code around limitations to automation tooling.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turing's revenge:</strong>  Making a complex configuration language over the course of many extensions to the language.</p>
